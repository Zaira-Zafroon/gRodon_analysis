Users should be cutious when interpreting results for organisms with predicted doubling times greater than 5 hours -point noted
First thing is t figure out, where the gene calls are from. If they are from the whole contigs I am great.
I can use that, run blast and then be done.
if not, I need to use Prokka to aanlyze it.
Also, I need to do the coverage stuff.
I can try to do the weighted vs unweighted first, Then based on results i Cna do a collreaton analysis and do the rest of my code.
