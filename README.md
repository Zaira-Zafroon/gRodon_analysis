Users should be cutious when interpreting results for organisms with predicted doubling times greater than 5 hours -point noted
First thing is t figure out, where the gene calls are from. If they are from the whole contigs I am great.
I can use that, run blast and then be done.
if not, I need to use Prokka to aanlyze it.
Also, I need to do the coverage stuff.
I can try to do the weighted vs unweighted first, Then based on results i Cna do a collreaton analysis and do the rest of my code.

Total runtime for 1,000 metagenomes (on a single core):

Total time=1,000 ×114=114,000 seconds (114 seconds on average per genme/1.9 min)
Number of cores required:

Cores
=Total time /Available time = 114,000/259,200≈ 0.44.
temparature is an optional predictor here. we dont know temparature or we can chck as well.Dont know what would be great here 
Temperature as a Variable: If you have information on the optimal growth temperatures of the microbial species present in your samples or if you can estimate the environmental temperatures during sample collection, consider including this as a variable in your analysis. This can enhance the accuracy of your growth rate predictions.
